# at the end since the description() function takes no arguments and it only needs me to specify which object of this new 
# class i'm interested in. Hence, hippo.description.

# i need to add "self" as first argument IN ALL METHODS that i create in this newly created class. The syntax needs it to know 
# what to refer to. Even if i create a function that will take no argument, in the method definition I HAVE TO ADD "SELF".

# INHERITANCE
# Inheritance is the process by which one class takes on the attributes and methods of another, and it's used
# to express an is-a relationship. For example, a Panda is a bear, so a Panda class could inherit from a Bear class.
# However, a Toyota is not a Tractor, so it shouldn't inherit from the Tractor class (even if they have a lot of attributes
# and methods in common). Instead, both Toyota and Tractor could ultimately inherit from the same Vehicle class.
# We've defined a class, Customer, as well as a ReturningCustomer class that inherits from Customer. Note that we don't
# define the display_cart method in the body of ReturningCustomer, but it will still have access to that method
# via inheritance.
class Customer(object):

    def __init__(self, customer_id):
        self.customer_id = customer_id

# CREATING USEFUL CLASSES
# Since i won't be creating Triangle or ElectricCar classes in my future job:), it's time for something more useful.
# a new class is a way of storing and accessing abstract collections of data. one useful class method to override is
# the built-in __repr__() method, which is short for representation; by providing a return value in this method, we can tell
# Python how to represent an object of our class (for instance, when using a print statement). see below:

    def __init__(self, x, y, z):
        self.x = x

my_point = Point3D(1, 2, 3)
print my_point
